# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At any point in time, we only support the latest version of Vulnerability Lookup.
There will be no security patches for other releases (tagged or not).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case of a security vulnerability report, we ask the reporter to send it directly to
[CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/contact/), if possible encrypted with the following GnuPG key:
**CA57 2205 C002 4E06 BA70 BE89 EAAD CFFC 22BD 4CD5**.

If you report security vulnerabilities, do not forget to **tell us if and how you want to
be acknowledged** and if you already requested CVE(s). Otherwise, we will request the CVE(s) directly.
