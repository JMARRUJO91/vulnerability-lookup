Presentation
------------

Vulnerability Lookup facilitates quick correlation of vulnerabilities from various sources,
independent of vulnerability IDs, and streamlines the management of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD).
Vulnerability Lookup is also a collaborative platform where users can comment on security advisories and create bundles.

A Vulnerability Lookup instance operated by `CIRCL <https://www.circl.lu>`_
is available at https://vulnerability.circl.lu.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- A fast lookup API to search for vulnerabilities and find correlation per vulnerability identifier.
- Modular system to import different vulnerability sources.
- An API for adding new vulnerability including ID assigment, state and disclosure.
- Creation, edition and fork/copy of Security Advisories with the `vulnogram editor <https://github.com/Vulnogram>`_.
- A user management system to support comment, report and admin of vulnerability advisories.
- Ability to add, review and share comments on vulnerability advisories.
- Possibility to create bundles of vulnerability advisories with a description.
- An extensive RSS and Atom support for vulnerabilities and comments.

Why Vulnerability Lookup ?
--------------------------

Vulnerability Lookup is a rewritten version of cve-search, an open-source tool initially aimed at maintaining a local CVE database.
The original cve-search had design and scalability limitations, and its public instance operated by CIRCL is maxing out at 20,000 queries per second.

As vulnerability sources have diversified beyond the NVD CVE, a new tool was needed to support the CVD process,
allowing for bundling, commenting, publishing, and extending vulnerability information in a collaborative manner.
